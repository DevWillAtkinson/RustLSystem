## What is an L-System?
L-System is short for [Lindenmayer System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system).
L-Systems are a set of rules and a related alphabet that can be used to descrbe or model iterative or recursive behaviour.

L-Systems are commonly combined with turtles to draw fractiles.  
This application is one example of the combination.
